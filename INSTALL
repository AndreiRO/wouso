WoUSO Installation
==================

	* TODO

First run:
	cp settings.py.example settings.py #and customize for your needs
	./manage.py syncdb
		- choose yes, and create a super user
	./default_setup.bash
	./manage.py runserver

Hints:
    * for active development, you may "ln -s" settings.py instead of copying.
    * also, if you want to drop tables for one app, i.e. core.user, use:
		./manage.py sqlclear user | ./manage.py dbshell

Server setup:
	add in crontab ./scripts/eot.bash, daily.
